## 2026-04-20 (Week 1, later)

**Done:**
- **SV-CARD-01 + SV-SIGN-01 assertion logic complete, passing on the pinned spec vector.** No live Runner required.
  - SV-CARD-01 vector path: card JSON validates against `schemas/agent-card.schema.json` (JSON Schema 2020-12 via `santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema/v5`); JCS canonicalization is idempotent (1617 canonical bytes).
  - SV-SIGN-01 vector path: JWS structurally valid — three segments, EdDSA alg, `typ=soa-agent-card+jws`, non-empty `kid`, detached payload; signing-input re-canonicalization succeeds. Placeholder-'0' signature detected; full crypto verify deferred per vector design.
- `internal/specvec` — pinned-vector locator (wraps `--spec-vectors` root, exposes well-known paths for card/schema/jws).
- `internal/agentcard` — `ValidateJSON` (schema) + `ParseJWS` (structural + header) + `IsPlaceholderSignature`. 7 unit tests.
- `internal/runner` — TLS finalization:
  - `BuildTLSConfig(TLSOptions{…})` — trust anchor from PEM file, optional client cert/key for mTLS, SNI override, min TLS 1.2.
  - Bearer injection, `/health`, `/ready`, SSE consumer for `/stream/v1/{sessionID}` — all now covered by unit tests against pure-Go `httptest.Server` + `httptest.NewTLSServer` fixtures (8 runner tests, including real mTLS trust-anchor round trip).
- `internal/testrunner` + `internal/junit` — per-path **Evidence** model:
  - Every test ID produces one Evidence entry per probe path (`vector`, `live`). Aggregate Status across entries: fail if any fail, else pass if any pass, else skip.
  - JUnit XML emits each Evidence as a `<property name="evidence.<path>" value="<status>">` and `<system-out>` summary. CI artifact now differentiates **passed-on-vector**, **passed-on-live**, **skipped-waiting-on-impl**, and **failed**.
- `release-gate.json` v2 adds `impl_url`, `live_path_enabled` fields and nested per-result `evidence[]` arrays.
- CLI: added `--impl-url` flag; `SOA_IMPL_URL` env var read as fallback; `--runner-url` kept as back-compat alias. Live path is enabled only when the target answers a 3-second health probe.

**Active:**
- Nothing blocking on this side for vector-path Week 1 work. Waiting on impl's `/.well-known/agent-card.json` + `.jws` endpoints to exercise live path.

**When impl Runner is up, flipping to live-path is zero-code-change on our side:**
- `SOA_IMPL_URL=https://runner.example.com:7700 soa-validate --profile=core --spec-vectors=<spec>` enables live checks automatically.
- For mTLS: pass `--impl-url` + configure TLS trust-anchor PEM (wiring that flag is a 5-min follow-up, will land alongside the first live-successful run).

**Spec commits this validator assumes exist:**
- `6c1bc99` — committed `generated/` parity vectors; MANIFEST unchanged since `208e5dd`.

## 2026-04-20 (earlier)

**Done:**
- Week 0 complete. Static Go binary builds, `go vet ./...` clean, `go test ./...` green.
- `internal/musmap` — SV + UV must-map loader + structural validator. Confirms 213-test catalog round-trips.
- `internal/jcs` — RFC 8785 canonicalizer (uses `github.com/gowebpki/jcs v1.0.1`) + parity harness against spec's `test-vectors/jcs-parity/generated/*.json`. **47/47 cases agree** across both libraries (floats 15, integers 9, nested 11, strings 12). JCS byte-equivalence invariant is proven on this side.
- `internal/digest` — SHA-256 helpers matching spec's `build-manifest.mjs` convention.
- `internal/runner` — HTTP client with mTLS + bearer + SSE consumer for `/stream/v1/{sessionID}`, `/health` + `/ready` probes.
- `internal/testrunner` — phase-ordered dispatch from must-map to handler. Stub handlers registered for all 8 M1 test IDs (`HR-01, HR-02, HR-12, HR-14, SV-SIGN-01, SV-CARD-01, SV-BOOT-01, SV-PERM-01`), all returning `skip` with "assertions land in M1 week N".
- `internal/junit` — JUnit XML emitter. Week 0 exit command emits 8/8 skipped.
- `soa-validate.lock` bumped `208e5dd → 6c1bc99` (see pin_history). MANIFEST unchanged between those commits.

**Active:**
- M1 Week 1 assertions for `SV-CARD-01` + `SV-SIGN-01`.

**Blocked:**
- Sibling impl lockstep pin bump (resolved in the impl's own Week-0 sign-off commit — both repos now pinned at `6c1bc99`).
