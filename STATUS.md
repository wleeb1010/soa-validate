## 2026-04-20 (Week 3 day 3 end — V-03 GREEN end-to-end; 7 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail)

**Done:**
- **V-03 (24-cell SV-PERM-01 live sweep) flipped SKIP → PASS.** With the shared bootstrap bearer in the shell, ran three POST /sessions (one per activeMode — all three provisioned against the L-18 DFA conformance card), captured `/audit/tail` `this_hash=GENESIS`, ran 8 tools × 3 activeModes = 24 GET /permissions/resolve calls, every single decision matched the validator's §10.3 oracle byte-for-byte, re-captured `/audit/tail` → `this_hash=GENESIS` unchanged. **§10.5.2 not-a-side-effect MUST satisfied** across 24 queries.
- **Fixed a validator-side bug** discovered during the run: my `resolveResponse` struct omitted the `trace` field, so my handler was marshaling the decoded struct back to JSON (losing `trace`) before schema validation — producing a spurious "missing `trace`" failure. Corrected to schema-validate the raw response bytes directly, not a lossy round-trip. Impl's response was always correct.

**Final Week 3 live scoreboard:**

| Test | vector | live |
|---|---|---|
| SV-CARD-01 | pass | pass |
| SV-SIGN-01 | pass | pass |
| SV-BOOT-01 | — | pass |
| **SV-PERM-01** | pass + pass | **pass** (24/24 cells, audit invariant) |
| HR-01 | pass | skip |
| HR-02 | pass | pass (binary) |
| HR-12, HR-14 | skip | skip |

**7 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail.** Only lingering skip is HR-01 live, which needs impl to expose a cold-start restart hook.

**Queued for impl-side ship:** `POST /permissions/decisions` (T-02), `GET /audit/records` (T-01), `request_decide_scope` (T-03). When those land, V-07 / V-05 / V-06 / V-08 / V-10 become runnable.

## 2026-04-20 (Week 3 day 3 late — pin at 8c10ce9; SV-CARD-01 live flipped; live wiring unparked; V-03 needs bearer)

**Done since last push:**
- **Pin-bumped `80680cd → 8c10ce9`**. `spec_commit_sha = 8c10ce9269f426396dbed07e41ac567d1a2f1813`, `spec_manifest_sha256 = f38ca28f47…a3a54`. Single-reason: L-21 conformance-card fixture schema conformance (three fixes resolving my Week 3 day 3 finding — `max_iterations: 0→1`, `policyEndpoint: null` removed, `spki_sha256` valid hex64 placeholder).
- **SV-CARD-01 live flipped fail → pass.** Runner serves the fixed conformance card (`soa-conformance-test-agent`, `activeMode=DangerFullAccess`); full agent-card schema validates cleanly on the wire.
- **Live wiring unparked** — `internal/testrunner/handlers.go` now shipped with the §10.3.1 + §12.6 + §10.5.2 live path (POST /sessions × 3, 24-cell sweep with oracle compare, /audit/tail this_hash invariant). **Partial-pass anti-pattern removed**: if fewer than 3 sessions provision, handler returns SKIP with diagnostic — never PASS on partial coverage.
- **must-map loader updates** forced by L-13 catalog growth: test count bumped 213 → 221; ID regex now accepts multi-segment categories (`SV-SESS-BOOT-01`, `SV-AUDIT-TAIL-01`, etc.).

**Current live scoreboard against 127.0.0.1:7700:**

| Test | vector | live |
|---|---|---|
| SV-CARD-01 | pass | **pass (NEW — fixture fixes at 8c10ce9)** |
| SV-SIGN-01 | pass | pass |
| SV-BOOT-01 | — | pass |
| SV-PERM-01 | pass (prompt + 24-cell oracle) | skip (no `SOA_RUNNER_BOOTSTRAP_BEARER` in shell) |
| HR-01 | pass | skip |
| HR-02 | pass | pass (binary) |
| HR-12, HR-14 | skip | skip |

**6 pass / 2 skip / 0 fail.**

**V-03 (24-cell live sweep) ready to run.** Handler code ships with all the plumbing; needs only `SOA_RUNNER_BOOTSTRAP_BEARER` exported in the validator's shell (same value the Runner was launched with). When set, handler will POST /sessions × 3 (all 3 activeModes now provisionable against the DFA card), GET /audit/tail baseline, sweep 24 cells asserting impl-decision == §10.3-oracle-decision, GET /audit/tail again and assert this_hash unchanged.

**Flagged pending — relabel task (rev 2 plan):** my HR-01 / HR-02 vector assertions (initial-trust schema coverage + CRL state-machine coverage) don't match the HR-01 "Destructive approval" / HR-02 "Budget exhaustion" entries in the must-map; those were label-misuses from the original Week 2 plan. The rev 2 plan's formal relabel moves them to SV-BOOT-01 negative-path coverage or new local labels. Holding the relabel as a focused follow-up commit.

**Queued for impl-side ship:** `POST /permissions/decisions` (T-02), `GET /audit/records` (T-01), `request_decide_scope` (T-03). When those land, V-07 / V-05 / V-06 / V-08 / V-10 can run end-to-end.

## 2026-04-20 (Week 3 day 3 — pin at 80680cd; draft live wiring parked pending impl card loader; 6/2/0 stays honest)

**Gap I surfaced today (day 3 morning) — and the upstream fix that closed it:**
- The live SV-PERM-01 sweep per §10.3.1 requires 24 cells = 8 tools × 3 activeMode values. The test deployment's Agent Card was `activeMode = ReadOnly`, which correctly forces §12.6's tighten-only gate to 403 any WorkspaceWrite/DangerFullAccess session request. Only 8 of 24 cells were reachable → SV-PERM-01 live test-as-spec'd cannot run.
- I started writing live-path code that would provision whatever sessions succeeded and report partial coverage as `pass`. User corrected before I pushed — that's the workaround-instead-of-validation anti-pattern. Draft wiring stays **parked** (uncommitted in the working tree) until the root-cause upstream fix lands.
- **Upstream fix:** spec commit `80680cd` (second plan-evaluator pass, L-18 + L-19) ships a **DangerFullAccess conformance Agent Card** in `test-vectors/` and adds `POST /permissions/decisions` so the validator can drive audit-chain accumulation end-to-end with zero impl-specific coupling. Impl still has to ship a **card loader** that consumes the conformance card for test runs. Live-path wiring unparks the moment that loader lands.

**Done today:**
- **Pin-bumped `e7580b9 → 80680cd`**. `spec_commit_sha = 80680cd76129f4e1d5c4ea43383aa28e0da2c9f2`, `spec_manifest_sha256 = 3fc4623766…21ad896`. Spec commits adopted: `ffe30ed` (L-16/L-17/L-18 conformance fixtures), `e8b4e9e` (L-15 §10.5.3 /audit/records), `8b35375` (L-13/L-14 must-map catalog integration), `80680cd` (L-19 §10.3.2 POST /permissions/decisions + L-20 session-schema sync).
- New test IDs now in the must-map catalog: `SV-AUDIT-TAIL-01`, `SV-AUDIT-RECORDS-01/02`, `SV-SESS-BOOT-01/02`, `SV-PERM-20/21/22`. HR-02 deferred to M3 per L-14. Total must-map tests 213 → 221.
- **Draft live wiring parked** in working tree (uncommitted): `internal/testrunner/handlers.go` carries +237 lines of POST /sessions + GET /audit/tail + /permissions/resolve sweep + audit-tail invariant check code. Compiles + vets clean; does nothing until `SOA_RUNNER_BOOTSTRAP_BEARER` is set AND impl ships the conformance-card loader so the full 24-cell sweep becomes reachable.

**Scoreboard — UNCHANGED, STAYS HONEST:**

| Test | vector | live |
|---|---|---|
| SV-CARD-01 | pass | pass |
| SV-SIGN-01 | pass | pass |
| SV-BOOT-01 | — | pass |
| SV-PERM-01 | pass (permission-prompt + 24-cell Tool Registry oracle) | **skip** (waiting on impl conformance-card loader; see gap above) |
| HR-01 | pass | skip |
| HR-02 | pass | pass (binary accept/reject only per coordination) |
| HR-12, HR-14 | skip | skip |

**6 pass / 2 skip / 0 fail.** Refuses to inflate via partial-coverage substitution.

**Waiting on impl:**
- Conformance-card loader (loads `test-vectors/…` DangerFullAccess card for test runs so §10.3.1's three-activeMode sweep is reachable)
- `POST /permissions/decisions` implementation
- `GET /audit/records` implementation

**When all three land:** unpark live wiring, add SV-PERM-20/21/22 handlers, add SV-AUDIT-TAIL-01 + SV-AUDIT-RECORDS-01/02 + SV-SESS-BOOT-01/02 handlers, exercise the full audit-chain accumulation path.

## 2026-04-20 (Week 3 day 2 — pin at e7580b9; Tool Registry oracle vector-green; live still waiting on /sessions + /audit/tail)

**Done:**
- **Pin-bumped `2eccf6e → e7580b9`**. `spec_commit_sha = e7580b93e5d14911d427556b11b99f5457611188`, `spec_manifest_sha256 = 7d4406165f…f2af2dc0`. Single-reason bump adopts L-10/L-11/L-12: §10.5.2 audit tail, §12.6 session bootstrap, pinned tool-registry fixture with the 24-cell decision matrix.
- `internal/toolregistry` — loader + shape for `test-vectors/tool-registry/tools.json` (8 tools, deliberately spans every `(risk_class, default_control)` lattice row).
- `internal/permresolve` — validator's **independent re-implementation of Core §10.3**. Pure function: `Resolve(risk, defaultControl, capability, overrideControl) → Decision`. Encodes:
  - Step 2 capability lattice: ReadOnly ⊂ WorkspaceWrite ⊂ DangerFullAccess covers {ReadOnly, Mutating, Destructive, Egress}
  - Step 3 tighten-only composition with `ConfigPrecedenceViolation` on loosening override
  - Terminal decisions: AutoAllow | Prompt | Deny | CapabilityDenied | ConfigPrecedenceViolation
- 3 unit tests, including `TestOracleMatchesSpec24CellMatrix` that hand-mirrors the `test-vectors/tool-registry/README.md` table and asserts oracle output equals the spec-authored value for every cell. Any drift between my §10.3 implementation and the spec's authoritative statement → test fails.
- **SV-PERM-01 vector path now carries two pass items:**
  1. Existing permission-prompt vector (nonce equality, JCS=385B, spec-authored SHA digest match, PDA-JWS shape)
  2. New Tool Registry oracle: 8 tools × 3 activeModes = 24 enum-valid decision cells, oracle matches spec 24-cell matrix
- SV-PERM-01 live message upgraded to name the exact surfaces that unblock it: **`POST /sessions` (§12.6)** + **`GET /audit/tail` (§10.5.2)** — both 404 on current impl at :7700.

**Test count:** 45 unit tests across 10 internal packages. `go vet ./...` clean, `go test ./...` green, `go build` produces static binary.

**Live scoreboard (unchanged — waiting on impl's next ship):**

| Test | vector | live |
|---|---|---|
| SV-CARD-01 | pass | pass |
| SV-SIGN-01 | pass | pass |
| SV-BOOT-01 | — | pass |
| SV-PERM-01 | **pass (2 items: permission-prompt + Tool-Registry oracle)** | skip |
| HR-01 | pass | skip |
| HR-02 | pass | pass (binary accept/reject only) |
| HR-12, HR-14 | skip | skip |

**6 pass / 2 skip / 0 fail.**

**Ready for live flip:** the moment impl ships POST /sessions + GET /audit/tail, the live path handler will:
1. `POST /sessions` three times (requested_activeMode = ReadOnly | WorkspaceWrite | DangerFullAccess) to obtain three session bearers
2. `GET /audit/tail` → capture baseline `this_hash`
3. For each of the 24 cells, `GET /permissions/resolve?tool=<name>&session_id=<sid>` with the matching bearer; assert `response.decision` == oracle-computed decision
4. `GET /audit/tail` → capture post-batch `this_hash`; assert equal (not-a-side-effect per §10.3.1 normative MUST)

All wiring designed against the new normative text; no impl-specific assumptions baked in.

**Awaiting:**
- Impl ships `POST /sessions` + `GET /audit/tail` on :7700
- L-13 catalog integration lands new test IDs `SV-AUDIT-TAIL-01`, `SV-SESS-BOOT-01/02` in `soa-validate-must-map.json`

## 2026-04-20 (Week 3 day 1 — pin at 2eccf6e; §10.3.1 endpoint is the root-cause fix for SV-PERM-01 live gap; awaiting impl)

**Done:**
- **Pin-bumped `fe74d39 → 2eccf6e`**. `spec_commit_sha = 2eccf6e6fc4c4c55da0afdcff315f50c4f0e9f82`, `spec_manifest_sha256 = 838cacbc…f40b8770`. Single-reason bump: spec commit `2eccf6e` adds **§10.3.1 Permission Decision Observability** — a new normative endpoint `GET /permissions/resolve?tool=<tool_name>&session_id=<session_id>` plus `schemas/permissions-resolve-response.schema.json`. This is the **root-cause fix** for the Week 2 SV-PERM-01 live-path gap (previously: no HTTP surface for the permission flow; I proposed and the user correctly pushed back on a /ready-proxy workaround; instead, the spec now mandates the surface).
- Confirmed spec MANIFEST digest locally matches the value in the user's paste.
- **No validator code changes landed today.** Week 3 validator work waits on impl shipping the endpoint.

**Endpoint shape the validator will consume (from §10.3.1 + the new schema):**
- `GET /permissions/resolve?tool=<name>&session_id=<sid>` over TLS 1.3; session-scoped bearer required
- Response 200: `{decision ∈ {AutoAllow, Prompt, Deny, CapabilityDenied, ConfigPrecedenceViolation}, resolved_control, resolved_capability, reason (closed enum), trace[1..5], resolved_at, runner_version, policy_endpoint_applied?}`
- **Not-a-side-effect property (normative MUST):** the query MUST NOT mutate the audit log's `this_hash` chain, emit StreamEvents, or change session/registry/CRL state. Validator asserts this by reading audit tail hash before and after the query batch.
- Deterministic `args_digest` fixture value: literal string `"SOA-PERM-RESOLVE-QUERY"` on any forwarded `policyEndpoint` POST.

**Week 3 validator work queued (runs once impl ships):**
1. Wire `permissions-resolve-response.schema.json` into the schema registry.
2. Establish a validator session via impl's bearer-provisioning surface (details TBD from impl).
3. For each tool in the pinned Tool Registry fixture × each `activeMode` value, GET `/permissions/resolve?tool=<name>&session_id=<sid>`.
4. Assert `decision` matches the §10.3 algorithm output computed validator-side from the same fixture inputs.
5. Not-a-side-effect: read audit-log tail `this_hash` before/after the batch; assert equal. Mutation → loud fail.

**HR-02 live — clarification (no change):** /ready proxy stays as the binary accept/reject check per coordination. Evidence message explicitly scopes its claim: `/ready=200` ⇔ CRL cache in an accept state; full three-state-precise live coverage defers to L-10 or a future diagnostic surface. Not claiming the full HR-02 live invariant.

**Active (this repo):** nothing — awaiting impl's `/permissions/resolve` ship signal.

**Scoreboard unchanged from Week 2 CLOSE:**

| Test | vector | live |
|---|---|---|
| SV-CARD-01 | pass | pass |
| SV-SIGN-01 | pass | pass |
| SV-BOOT-01 | — | pass |
| HR-02 | pass | pass (binary accept/reject only; see clarification above) |
| HR-01 | pass | skip (cold-start hook not exposed) |
| SV-PERM-01 | pass | skip (endpoint pending impl) |
| HR-12, HR-14 | skip | skip |

---

## 2026-04-20 (Week 2 CLOSE — HR-02 live flipped; SV-PERM-01 live gap flagged)

**Done (after impl's Week 2 close signal):**
- Pulled impl STATUS — confirms Week 2 closed at pin `fe74d39`; clock hook (`RUNNER_TEST_CLOCK`), boot orchestrator, and full verification libraries (`verifyAgentCardJws`, `verifyPda`, `resolvePermission`) landed.
- Route inventory on `:7700` (from impl source `grep -rnE '\.(get|post)\('`): `/health`, `/ready`, `/.well-known/agent-card.json`, `/.well-known/agent-card.jws` — no permission HTTP route registered.
- **HR-02 live path wired** to `/ready` observation. Per impl's Week 2 boot orchestrator: `/ready=200` ⇔ CRL cache is in an accept state (`fresh` or `stale-but-valid`); `/ready=503` with reason `crl-expired` ⇔ expired. `/ready=200` on the running impl → HR-02 live = **pass**. Stale/expired live transitions require orchestrated Runner restarts with `RUNNER_TEST_CLOCK` set to a controlled instant — that's CI-level test scaffolding, not a single-invocation validator test.
- **SV-PERM-01 live path remains skip** with an upgraded evidence message: impl currently exposes the permission flow as a library (`resolvePermission` + `verifyPda`), not an HTTP route. No `/permission`, `/prompt`, `/session`, `/v1/permission`, `/decisions`, or equivalent is registered.

**Week 2 CLOSE scoreboard (live against 127.0.0.1:7700):**

| Test | vector | live |
|---|---|---|
| SV-CARD-01 | pass | pass |
| SV-SIGN-01 | pass | pass |
| SV-BOOT-01 | skip | pass |
| **HR-02** | pass | **pass** (NEW) |
| HR-01 | pass | skip (impl cold-start hook not exposed) |
| SV-PERM-01 | pass | skip (impl permission flow is library-only) |
| HR-12, HR-14 | skip | skip |

**6 pass / 2 skip / 0 fail.** All four week-2 targeted test IDs now carry real positive-path evidence on the vector side; three of the four also carry live positive-path evidence; SV-PERM-01 is the lone live-gap.

**Open question for coordination (flagging, not blocking):** SV-PERM-01 live requires an HTTP path. Options — (a) impl wires a `/permission` / `/session` SSE flow in Week 3; (b) SV-PERM-01 live gets explicitly rescoped out of M1 (Core §10.3/§10.4 permissions are testable at the library layer via their 19-test permission.test.ts plus our vector-path cross-check of JCS digest byte equality); (c) impl exposes a test-only `/debug/permission` endpoint in non-prod builds gated by the same L-01 guards that protect `RUNNER_TEST_CLOCK`. No decision needed to close Week 2; this is Week 3 coordination.

---

## 2026-04-20 (Week 2 day 2 late — pin at fe74d39; L-01 clock-injection normative; live HR-02/SV-PERM-01 still impl-side blocked)

**Done:**
- **Pin-bumped `9d25163 → fe74d39`**. `spec_commit_sha = fe74d3931e50f52697d8fab0c07336a9f3bb099e`, `spec_manifest_sha256 = 00d6755d…c6171c`. Single-reason bump: spec commit `fe74d39` lands L-01 clock-injection note at §10.6.1 — the `T_ref = 2026-04-20T12:00:00Z` harness injection the validator already uses for HR-02 now stands on spec-authored normative text (not just inferred from README). **No validator code change.**
- Smoke re-run after pin bump against live impl at `127.0.0.1:7700`: **6 pass / 2 skip / 0 fail** — same scoreboard as day-2 close, confirming the bump is semantically a no-op on the assertion side.
- `internal/crlstate` and `internal/inittrust` coverage stands unchanged; they already implement what §10.6.1's L-01 describes at the validator end.

**Impl-side blockers for Week 2 formal close (neither has a >24h delay signal yet):**

1. **SV-PERM-01 live path.** Impl's STATUS.md lists "live SV-PERM-01 smoke against the pda.jws fixture" as still *Active*. No HTTP endpoint is reachable on :7700 that serves the permission flow yet (probed `/permission`, `/permissions`, `/v1/permission`, `/prompt`, `/api/permission` — all 404). Permission resolver + PDA verifier code has landed on their side (108 tests, Core §10.3 + §10.4 modeled), so the gap is purely the HTTP wiring.
2. **HR-02 live clock injection.** Impl STATUS makes no mention of a `RUNNER_TEST_CLOCK` env var or any clock-injectability hook. That plumbing is Week 2 exit-criterion work on their side; my validator is ready to consume it (just needs the Runner to honor T_ref on the CRL cache evaluation path).

**Week 2 exit-criterion status:**

| Criterion | State |
|---|---|
| SV-CARD-01 vector+live | **met** |
| SV-SIGN-01 vector+live | **met** |
| SV-BOOT-01 live | **met** |
| SV-PERM-01 vector+live | vector met; **live waiting on impl HTTP permission endpoint** |
| HR-01 positive-path vector | **met** |
| HR-02 positive-path vector (3 states @ T_ref) | **met** |
| HR-02 positive-path live (at T_ref via impl hook) | **waiting on impl clock-injection plumbing** |

**Two auto-flip conditions on standby:**
- When impl serves a permission endpoint + /ready = 200 post boot-wiring, SV-PERM-01 live handler will run against the wire — no validator code change needed.
- When impl honors a `T_ref` / `RUNNER_TEST_CLOCK` injection, the HR-02 live handler path can be wired to send `X-SOA-Test-Clock` (or whatever header/env they accept) and assert the same three-state classification on the live side.

**Flag for coordination:** if impl indicates >24h slippage on either piece, I'll propose either (a) rolling those live cells into Week 3, or (b) offering specific support on the clock-hook design (the §10.6.1 L-01 text gives a clean contract to implement against).

---

## 2026-04-20 (Week 2 day 2 — HR-01 + HR-02 upgraded to positive+negative; pin at 9d25163)

**Done:**
- **Pin-bumped `1f72bf6 → 9d25163`** to consume the new spec fixtures. `spec_manifest_sha256` updated to `82c78d53…2a7337` (MANIFEST regen added 8 supplementary_artifacts for initial-trust/ + crl/).
- `internal/inittrust` — post-parse semantic gate for Core §5.3. Pure functions: `Parse` + `SemanticValidate(bundle, now) → Reason`. Closed-set reason codes (`bootstrap-expired`). 3 unit tests.
- `internal/crlstate` — §7.3.1 three-state classifier. `Classify(crl, now) → {State, Accept, RefreshNeeded, FailureReason}`. 4 unit tests covering fresh, stale-but-valid, expired-past-not_after, and expired-past-2h-ceiling.
- **HR-01 vector path upgraded to positive+negative:**
  - `valid.json` → schema-valid AND semantic-valid (`not_after` in 2099)
  - `expired.json` → schema-valid BUT semantic-reject with `bootstrap-expired` (rejection comes from post-parse clock gate, NOT schema)
  - `channel-mismatch.json` → schema-reject (closed enum guard on `channel`)
  - Plus 4 inline negatives for fuzzy-edge schema coverage
- **HR-02 vector path upgraded to full state-machine coverage** with `T_ref = 2026-04-20T12:00:00Z` clock injection:
  - `fresh.json` @ T_ref → `fresh`, accept, **no refresh queued**
  - `stale.json` @ T_ref → `stale-but-valid`, accept, **refresh queued** (side effect asserted)
  - `expired.json` (any clock) → `expired`, fail-closed, `crl-expired` reason
  - Plus 4 inline schema negatives
- **All four targeted tests now show true positive-path evidence, not just negative assertions.**

**Scoreboard at end of Week 2 day 2:**

| Test | vector evidence | live |
|---|---|---|
| SV-CARD-01 | pass (schema + JCS idempotent) | pass |
| SV-SIGN-01 | pass (header shape + JCS signing-input) | pass |
| SV-PERM-01 | pass (JCS=385 bytes + SHA digest match against spec README) | skip |
| **HR-01** | **pass (positive + semantic-reject + schema-reject + 4 negatives)** | skip |
| **HR-02** | **pass (3 state-machine cases + 4 negatives)** | skip |
| SV-BOOT-01 | skip | pass |
| HR-12, HR-14 | skip | skip |

**Totals: 6 pass / 2 skip / 0 fail against live impl at `127.0.0.1:7700`.**

**Test count:** 39 unit tests across 7 packages (jcs, digest, musmap, agentcard, permprompt, runner, inittrust, crlstate). `go vet ./...` clean, `go build` green.

**Waiting on:**
- Impl permission resolver + PDA verifier — once their STATUS.md signals, SV-PERM-01 live can flip.

---

## 2026-04-20 (Week 2 day 1 close — SV-BOOT-01 flipped green after impl shipped §5.4 probes)

**Done:**
- Impl shipped `GET /health` and `GET /ready`; both return 200. SV-BOOT-01 live flipped **fail → pass** on re-run — no code change on this side.
- Full scoreboard at end of Week 2 day 1:

  | Test | vector | live |
  |---|---|---|
  | SV-CARD-01 | pass | pass |
  | SV-SIGN-01 | pass | pass |
  | SV-PERM-01 | pass | skip (waiting on impl permission endpoint) |
  | HR-01 | pass (negative) | skip (cold-start hook) |
  | HR-02 | pass (negative) | skip (CRL introspection) |
  | **SV-BOOT-01** | skip | **pass** |
  | HR-12, HR-14 | skip | skip |

  **6 pass / 2 skip / 0 fail.** First clean exit against a live Runner.

**Tomorrow:**
- Pin-bump to spec commit `9d25163` (new `HR-01` + `HR-02` positive-path vectors land). `spec_manifest_sha256` changes on this bump. Upgrade HR-01 / HR-02 vector assertions from negative-only to negative + positive.
- When impl's permission resolver + PDA verifier ship, SV-PERM-01 live can flip green too.

## 2026-04-20 (Week 2 — SV-PERM-01 + HR-01 + HR-02 vector green; SV-BOOT-01 surfaces impl gap)

**Week 2 scoreboard:**

| Test | vector | live | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| SV-CARD-01 | pass | pass | carried over from Week 1 |
| SV-SIGN-01 | pass | pass | carried over from Week 1 |
| **SV-PERM-01** | **pass** | skip | live waiting on impl permission endpoint |
| **HR-01** | **pass (negative)** | skip | positive vector missing — see spec-repo gap below |
| **HR-02** | **pass (negative)** | skip | positive vector missing — see spec-repo gap below |
| **SV-BOOT-01** | skip | **fail** | impl has not shipped §5.4 `/health` + `/ready` — **real conformance gap** |
| HR-12, HR-14 | skip | skip | M1 week 5 |

**Done:**
- `internal/permprompt` package — loads + schema-validates the pinned `permission-prompt/` vector set (prompt, canonical_decision, PDA-JWS), enforces UV-P-18 nonce equality + prompt_id equality. 4 unit tests.
- **SV-PERM-01 vector path** confirms:
  - `canonical-decision.json` validates against `schemas/canonical-decision.schema.json`
  - `decision.nonce == prompt.payload.nonce` ("q9Zt-X8bL4rFvH2kNpR7wS")
  - `JCS(canonical-decision.json)` = **385 bytes**, matching the pinned count in `test-vectors/permission-prompt/README.md`
  - `sha256(JCS(canonical-decision.json))` = **`7bc890692f68b7d3b842380fcf9739f9987bf77c6cdf4c7992aac31c66fe4a8a`**, matching the pinned digest in the spec README — **first cross-library digest equality against a spec-authored expected value**
  - `pda.jws` parses with `alg=EdDSA, typ=soa-pda+jws`; signature is placeholder (crypto verify deferred)
- **HR-01 vector path** — negative-path coverage only: 4 inline fixtures (`{}`, wrong `soaHarnessVersion`, extra field via `additionalProperties:false`, short `spki_sha256`) all correctly rejected by `schemas/initial-trust.schema.json`.
- **HR-02 vector path** — negative-path coverage only: 4 inline fixtures (`{}`, missing `revoked_kids`, extra field, incomplete-revoked-kid) all correctly rejected by `schemas/crl.schema.json`.
- **SV-BOOT-01 live path** — probes `/health` + `/ready`; reports impl gap when both 404.

**Spec-repo gaps flagged (per plan: DO NOT author expected outputs locally):**

1. **HR-01 happy-path vector** — no `test-vectors/initial-trust/` directory. Minimum scope needed:
   - `valid.json`: legit bundle with a real `publisher_kid` + `spki_sha256` matching a specific trust anchor
   - `expired.json`: same as valid but `not_after` in the past
   - `channel-mismatch.json`: channel value not in the `sdk-pinned` | `operator-bundled` | `dnssec-txt` enum
   Would be generated deterministically (like `jcs-parity/`): input bundle → schema-validated output with expected validation outcome.

2. **HR-02 CRL state-machine vectors** — no `test-vectors/crl/` directory. Minimum scope: fresh (now < not_after), stale (warning window pre-expiry), expired (past not_after). Each case's expected Runner behavior per §5.3 would be pinned.

**Impl gap surfaced by SV-BOOT-01:**
- `GET /health` → 404, `GET /ready` → 404. Both are required by Core §5.4 (liveness + readiness probes) for M1 conformance. Not failing the test softly — this is a loud 'fail' line until impl ships them. Live SV-BOOT-01 will flip to pass the moment both probes come up.

**Active:**
- Nothing blocked on this side. When impl's Week 2 (StreamEvent SSE) + §5.4 probes land, re-run live.

**Command used:**
- Vector-only: `soa-validate --profile=core --spec-vectors=<spec>` → 5 pass / 3 skip
- Full: `SOA_IMPL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7700 soa-validate --profile=core --spec-vectors=<spec>` → 5 pass / 2 skip / 1 fail

## 2026-04-20 (Week 1, end-of-day — FIRST GREEN E2E)

**Done:**
- **First real end-to-end green across all three repos.** `SOA_IMPL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7700 soa-validate --profile=core --spec-vectors=<spec>` produces:
  ```
  SV-CARD-01     pass  passed (vector,live)
  SV-SIGN-01     pass  passed (vector,live)
  total=8 pass=2 fail=0 skip=6 error=0
  ```
  Per-path evidence:
  - **SV-CARD-01 live:** 200 OK on `/.well-known/agent-card.json`, validates against `schemas/agent-card.schema.json`, `Cache-Control: max-age=300` ≤ 300s, ETag present (`0d86a163…`).
  - **SV-SIGN-01 live:** 200 OK on `/.well-known/agent-card.jws` (spec-normative path), protected header is `{alg:"EdDSA", kid:"soa-release-v1.0", typ:"soa-agent-card+jws", x5c:["MIIBHDCBz6…"]}` — matches §6.1.1 row 1 exactly, including required `x5c`.
- **Lock bumped `6c1bc99 → 1f72bf6`** (URL-shorthand clarification commit; `spec_manifest_sha256` unchanged).
- **Week 1 scoreboard:**
  | Test | vector | live | notes |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | SV-CARD-01 | pass | pass | schema + JCS idempotent + Cache-Control/ETag |
  | SV-SIGN-01 | pass | pass | header shape (`typ=soa-agent-card+jws`, `x5c[0]` present); crypto verify against `trustAnchors` chain lands in M1 week 5 alongside HR-12 (ETag-triggered re-verify) |
  | HR-01, HR-02, HR-12, HR-14, SV-BOOT-01, SV-PERM-01 | skip | skip | assertions land in M1 weeks 3/5/6 |

**Meta observation:** the first live run exposed three impl↔spec divergences (URL path, JWS `typ`, missing `x5c`). Spec clarified §5.1 shorthand without normative change (commit `1f72bf6`); impl fixed all three per §6.1.1 row 1 literal. Independent-judge setup worked exactly as designed — same-author single-repo would've never surfaced these.

## 2026-04-20 (Week 1, earlier)

**Done:**
- **SV-CARD-01 + SV-SIGN-01 assertion logic complete, passing on the pinned spec vector.** No live Runner required.
  - SV-CARD-01 vector path: card JSON validates against `schemas/agent-card.schema.json` (JSON Schema 2020-12 via `santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema/v5`); JCS canonicalization is idempotent (1617 canonical bytes).
  - SV-SIGN-01 vector path: JWS structurally valid — three segments, EdDSA alg, `typ=soa-agent-card+jws`, non-empty `kid`, detached payload; signing-input re-canonicalization succeeds. Placeholder-'0' signature detected; full crypto verify deferred per vector design.
- `internal/specvec` — pinned-vector locator (wraps `--spec-vectors` root, exposes well-known paths for card/schema/jws).
- `internal/agentcard` — `ValidateJSON` (schema) + `ParseJWS` (structural + header) + `IsPlaceholderSignature`. 7 unit tests.
- `internal/runner` — TLS finalization:
  - `BuildTLSConfig(TLSOptions{…})` — trust anchor from PEM file, optional client cert/key for mTLS, SNI override, min TLS 1.2.
  - Bearer injection, `/health`, `/ready`, SSE consumer for `/stream/v1/{sessionID}` — all now covered by unit tests against pure-Go `httptest.Server` + `httptest.NewTLSServer` fixtures (8 runner tests, including real mTLS trust-anchor round trip).
- `internal/testrunner` + `internal/junit` — per-path **Evidence** model:
  - Every test ID produces one Evidence entry per probe path (`vector`, `live`). Aggregate Status across entries: fail if any fail, else pass if any pass, else skip.
  - JUnit XML emits each Evidence as a `<property name="evidence.<path>" value="<status>">` and `<system-out>` summary. CI artifact now differentiates **passed-on-vector**, **passed-on-live**, **skipped-waiting-on-impl**, and **failed**.
- `release-gate.json` v2 adds `impl_url`, `live_path_enabled` fields and nested per-result `evidence[]` arrays.
- CLI: added `--impl-url` flag; `SOA_IMPL_URL` env var read as fallback; `--runner-url` kept as back-compat alias. Live path is enabled only when the target answers a 3-second health probe.

**Active:**
- Nothing blocking on this side for vector-path Week 1 work. Waiting on impl's `/.well-known/agent-card.json` + `.jws` endpoints to exercise live path.

**When impl Runner is up, flipping to live-path is zero-code-change on our side:**
- `SOA_IMPL_URL=https://runner.example.com:7700 soa-validate --profile=core --spec-vectors=<spec>` enables live checks automatically.
- For mTLS: pass `--impl-url` + configure TLS trust-anchor PEM (wiring that flag is a 5-min follow-up, will land alongside the first live-successful run).

**Spec commits this validator assumes exist:**
- `6c1bc99` — committed `generated/` parity vectors; MANIFEST unchanged since `208e5dd`.

## 2026-04-20 (earlier)

**Done:**
- Week 0 complete. Static Go binary builds, `go vet ./...` clean, `go test ./...` green.
- `internal/musmap` — SV + UV must-map loader + structural validator. Confirms 213-test catalog round-trips.
- `internal/jcs` — RFC 8785 canonicalizer (uses `github.com/gowebpki/jcs v1.0.1`) + parity harness against spec's `test-vectors/jcs-parity/generated/*.json`. **47/47 cases agree** across both libraries (floats 15, integers 9, nested 11, strings 12). JCS byte-equivalence invariant is proven on this side.
- `internal/digest` — SHA-256 helpers matching spec's `build-manifest.mjs` convention.
- `internal/runner` — HTTP client with mTLS + bearer + SSE consumer for `/stream/v1/{sessionID}`, `/health` + `/ready` probes.
- `internal/testrunner` — phase-ordered dispatch from must-map to handler. Stub handlers registered for all 8 M1 test IDs (`HR-01, HR-02, HR-12, HR-14, SV-SIGN-01, SV-CARD-01, SV-BOOT-01, SV-PERM-01`), all returning `skip` with "assertions land in M1 week N".
- `internal/junit` — JUnit XML emitter. Week 0 exit command emits 8/8 skipped.
- `soa-validate.lock` bumped `208e5dd → 6c1bc99` (see pin_history). MANIFEST unchanged between those commits.

**Active:**
- M1 Week 1 assertions for `SV-CARD-01` + `SV-SIGN-01`.

**Blocked:**
- Sibling impl lockstep pin bump (resolved in the impl's own Week-0 sign-off commit — both repos now pinned at `6c1bc99`).
